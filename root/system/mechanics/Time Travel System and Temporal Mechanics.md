# Time Travel System

## Fundamental Rules
### Time Stream Mechanics
1. Primary Timeline
   - Original sequence of events
   - Base reality anchor
   - Temporal stability index

2. Alternate Timelines
   - Branch creation rules
   - Stability requirements
   - Convergence mechanics

3. Temporal Constants
   - Fixed events
   - Universal laws
   - Paradox prevention mechanisms

## Time Travel Methods
### Natural Methods
1. Divine Intervention
   - Cost: Divine favor
   - Range: Unlimited
   - Restrictions: Divine approval

2. Temporal Anomalies
   - Cost: None
   - Range: Random
   - Restrictions: Unpredictable

### Artificial Methods
1. Time Magic
   - Cost: Massive mana consumption
   - Range: Based on power
   - Restrictions: Intelligence requirement

2. Artifacts
   - Cost: Artifact charge
   - Range: Pre-set
   - Restrictions: Cooldown period

## Temporal Effects
### Personal Timeline
```
Maximum Travel Range = (Intelligence × 50) days
Mana Cost = Base Cost × Distance × Temporal Resistance
Recovery Time = Travel Distance × 0.1 days
```

### World Effects
1. Minor Changes
   - Self-correcting
   - Limited ripple effect
   - Quick stability return

2. Major Changes
   - Timeline branches
   - Cascading effects
   - Stability challenges

3. Critical Changes
   - Reality fractures
   - Temporal storms
   - Universe reset risk

## Temporal Mechanics
### Time Dilation
```
Subjective Time = Real Time × Dilation Factor
Dilation Factor = 1 + (Temporal Power/1000)
Maximum Dilation = 10x
```

### Temporal Resistance
```
Resistance Value = Base Resistance × (1 + Time Traveled)
Damage Potential = Change Magnitude × Timeline Stability
Recovery Rate = Base Recovery × (1 + Intelligence Modifier)
```

## Paradox Management
### Paradox Types
1. Grandfather Paradox
   - Prevention mechanics
   - Resolution systems
   - Timeline protection

2. Bootstrap Paradox
   - Information loops
   - Object persistence
   - Causal chains

3. Temporal Echo
   - Effect stacking
   - Power amplification
   - Stability drain

### Paradox Resolution
```
Resolution Cost = Paradox Magnitude × Timeline Stress
Timeline Repair = Base Repair × (1 + Divine Intervention)
Maximum Paradox Threshold = Intelligence × Spirit × 0.1
```

## Multiple Time Travelers
### Interaction Rules
1. Temporal Synchronization
   - Power combination
   - Effect multiplication
   - Stability sharing

2. Conflict Resolution
   - Power priority
   - Timeline dominance
   - Effect cancellation

### Group Mechanics
```
Combined Power = Sum of Individual Powers × (0.8 ^ Number of Travelers)
Stability Cost = Base Cost × Group Size × Time Distance
Maximum Group Size = Timeline Stability ÷ 100
```

## Safety Mechanisms
### Personal Protection
1. Temporal Shielding
   - Memory preservation
   - Physical protection
   - Power conservation

2. Emergency Returns
   - Automatic triggers
   - Safe points
   - Power reserves

### Reality Protection
1. Timeline Stabilization
   - Auto-correction
   - Event preservation
   - Paradox prevention

2. Power Limiters
   - Usage restrictions
   - Cool-down periods
   - Energy caps

## Special Cases
### Divine Interaction
1. God-Level Time Control
   - Unlimited range
   - Perfect control
   - No paradox risk

2. Mortal Limitations
   - Power restrictions
   - Range limits
   - Consequence responsibility

### Forbidden Techniques
1. Timeline Manipulation
   - Reality rewriting
   - History elimination
   - Future locking

2. Temporal Warfare
   - Time loops
   - Age manipulation
   - Existence erasure
